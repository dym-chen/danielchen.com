        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm currently a computer engineering student at the University of Waterloo, most recently a intern for Shoplogix Inc.
          I am currently in a school term and am searching for a co-op position for the winter and summer of 2026.
          <br/><br/>
          I have a passion for problem solving and bringing ideas to life. There are lots of things I want to accomplish, 
          so I will take it one step at a time. As a result, n this site, I will share what I am working 
          on and try to document as much of it as possible for 3 reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I hope that the content can give you an idea of who I am and how do I think and work.
          </li>
          <li>
            I want to track my progress and see how I have grown over time, both as a person and as a developer.
          </li>
          <li>
            I just want somewhere to write sometimes, its pretty therapeutic ðŸ˜Š
          </li>
        </ol> 
        <p>

            Since I will use this website as a place to learn about Vue.JS and sharpen my front-end skills, there will be some time till I have the blog functionality available.
            In the meanwhile, please check out my posts and my leetcode history <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18QVK33-DUh6QE_N2nce1e0WQFc5651a8?usp=sharing ">here</a>.
